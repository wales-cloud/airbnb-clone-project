Overview
#This project is a backend clone of Airbnb, built to replicate essential functionalities such as user management, property listings, bookings, payment processing, and reviews. The focus is on creating a scalable, secure, and high-performance application.
#Project Goals
#Implement user registration, authentication, and profile management
#Develop property listing creation, updating, retrieval, and deletion features
#Build a booking system for users to reserve and manage stays
#Integrate payment processing for secure transactions
#Allow users to post and manage property reviews and ratings
#Optimize the database for fast and efficient data access
#Technology Stack
#Backend Framework: Django, Django REST Framework
#Database: PostgreSQL
#Caching: Redis
#Asynchronous Task Management: Celery
#API Standards: OpenAPI (REST) and GraphQL
#Containerization: Docker
#CI/CD: Automated testing and deployment pipelines

# Team Roles

## Backend Developer
Responsible for implementing the server-side application logic. This includes developing RESTful and GraphQL API endpoints, managing authentication and authorization processes, integrating external services such as payment gateways, and ensuring that the backend code is clean, scalable, and maintainable.

## Database Administrator
Oversees the design, implementation, and maintenance of the projectâ€™s databases. Responsibilities include optimizing queries, setting up indexing for faster data retrieval, maintaining database security, performing regular backups, and ensuring data integrity.

## DevOps Engineer
Manages the deployment and scaling of the backend services. Tasks include setting up CI/CD pipelines, maintaining Docker containers, configuring cloud environments, monitoring application performance, and implementing security best practices across infrastructure and deployments.

## QA Engineer
Ensures the quality and reliability of the application by developing and executing test plans. Responsibilities include writing automated tests for API endpoints, performing manual testing when necessary, identifying bugs and inconsistencies, and verifying that all features meet the project's functional and performance requirements.

# Technology Stack

## Django
A high-level Python web framework used to build the backend of the application. It handles server-side logic, user authentication, API endpoints, and overall application structure.

## Django REST Framework
An extension of Django that simplifies building RESTful APIs. It provides tools for serialization, authentication, permissions, and request handling.

## PostgreSQL
A powerful open-source relational database system used for storing and managing structured application data, including users, properties, bookings, and payments.

## GraphQL
A query language for APIs that provides a flexible and efficient way for clients to request only the data they need. It complements the REST API by allowing more customizable queries.

## Celery
A distributed task queue used to handle asynchronous operations such as sending email notifications and processing payment tasks outside of the main application flow.

## Redis
An in-memory data store used for caching and managing session data, helping improve performance and reduce database load.

## Docker
A containerization platform that packages the application and its dependencies into lightweight containers, ensuring consistency across different development, testing, and production environments.

## CI/CD Pipelines
Automated processes that run tests, build the application, and deploy changes to production. This ensures faster, more reliable development workflows.
